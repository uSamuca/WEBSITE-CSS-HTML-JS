            The challenge of time

            Right now time challenges you to be happy, pay close attention to what is happening...
            If you are in a place where nature prevails, look up at the sky and see the clouds that are constantly moving.
            See that the birds are singing happily, and the same wind that carries the clouds in different directions also blows a beautiful song into your ears revealing the secrets of happiness...
            Live this moment with full intensity.
            Smile and be happy with the people who are important to you.
            Forget the sadness and sorrows and remember that happiness lies in the simple things in life that sometimes you don't even notice, but as time goes by you will regret not having taken advantage of this moment and you will wish you could go back in time, the more you know , that this is impossible, because time only offers one opportunity in life for you to be happy, which is this moment now that you are living.
            So accept the challenge of time right now and live intensely moments of happiness now, so that tomorrow will be full of memories of the time when you were happy...<br><br>
            It is very sad when human beings use what could be good, to destroy others and their self-destruction, imposing fears. ..the moment something becomes discussion and disrespect, there is no longer anything there, the cause and the truth for which we set out to fight in unity, there is no longer any reason... If we try to help, practice something that we were taught good...we became targets...
            Everything that exists a system and interests does not exist human beings and nature....there is destruction and my heart cries and screams, because I would like to save the world and all living beings...but the being called human has choices and the Most always prefer to use the worst side... they don't understand that the summary of everything is our spiritual evolution, love and forgiveness. ..We are black and white, because we need both, to act with love and reason, for our balance... nothing can be too much because we suffer... we cannot change everything, because we suffer... but we only suffer when We forget that we have to love without waiting and give love to those who really want love... to help, we try... but not everyone is prepared for help, as they still need to help themselves... no one really sees your heart... .only the cover that will return to Earth. Blessed be â™¡ we can never regress for shadows that only use, those who want to be used to shake us. Let us be the cure for our planet.<br><br>
            Where I live? in a world where people chose to use their bad side to criticize and not be happy for your happiness, in a place where people pass by you, they are often forced to pull over in crowded transport and don't ask you for permission, or a simple good morning... a place where everyone prefers to lie than tell the truth, dominated by those who have more money, a place where being polite means appearing hypocritical, a place where expressing yourself means being arrogant... a place that judges you for what you wear and take pleasure in, a place where everything that raises awareness, or acts with kindness is seen as interests of wanting followers, a place that no matter how much someone wants to change, it becomes the wrong thing, in this place you don't see respect you see differences and divisions....
            Where do you live? in a place where none of that exists, no matter your color or what you do, respect exists and I will not change my way of being and expressing myself, for those who have not learned to educate themselves or preferred to regress out of complacency. We are evolving beings and your opinion, which is not constructive, does not interest me, we are in the same boat to different degrees, I can go up and you can go down, I can go down and you can go up in a second with our attitudes. But the important thing is to learn to be human , as many ceased to exist a long time ago.<br><br>
